# Wild-Fire-Urban-Interface

This repository contains my work at UC Berkeley.
The project was divided in three phases:

(i) First phase was to extract data, gain domain knowledge and find attributes that could be responsible for affecting the burned area in case of a wildfire.

(ii)In the second phase we worked on a data set (courtesy - UC Irvine lab) and performed various data wrangling and manipulation to determine what factors/attributes are contributing towards burning area. Performed linear and logistic regression and brought the accuracy near 75% (Because of the skewed and limited data, the efficiency of the model was restrained). 

(iii)In the Third Phase, taking inspiration from the UC Irvine database, we tried creating our own data set of Sierra Forest in California using Physics simulations and predicted the forest burn using ML models.

(iv) We further went to distinguish between smoke and fire by taking the help of Image classifier and Deep learning. Used CNN to bring the accurancy near 95%.
